The final project of the Interactive Data course of EMAT at KSU.

Milestone one 04/10/2023:
Report: The topic of the COVID-19 period and patient experience survey (HCAHPS) has been changed due to limited survey data over time. However, I have discovered a significant dataset on California hospitals with specific attributes such as "Year completed" and "Story," which can be used to cross-reference with the HCAHPS data of California.
Topic: the goal is to evaluate the patient experience in California, taking into account factors such as facility age. 
Audience: The target audience is healthcare architects, but this may change after consulting with NAC, a healthcare architecture company, to learn more about their clients.
